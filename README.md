# To Do list: interactive list

> In this project, you will add some functionality to your application to make it interactive. The user will also be able to mark task completion by selecting the corresponding checkbox (or undo it by unchecking the checkbox). The updated tasks list will be stored in local storage.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Used [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as bundler
- Icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- (Used Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint as linters)

## Live Demo

You can check a live working version of this project here: [live-demo](https://slowkingv.github.io/todo-list/)

## Getting started

This project makes use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle all the JS modules, and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons.

### Setup

Clone the repository into your local machine and then run `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Then after making any changes inside the `src/` folder, you can run `npm run build` to generate the corresponding files inside `dist/` directory.

### Run tests

If you want to test your changes on the fly without having to build every time, you can use `npm run start` to start the `webpack-dev-server` in development mode. This will watch for any changes you make and update the page accordingly.

To check the linters on your local env, make sure you have installed all dependencies (`npm install`) and then copy and paste the following files inside the root of the project: [.hintrc](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/html-css/.hintrc), [.stylelintrc.json](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/html-css/.stylelintrc.json), and [.eslintrc.json](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/html-css-js/.eslintrc.json).
