# Testing To Do list: part 1

> In this project you will write unit tests for the To Do list application. The testing project has been divided into two parts. In part 1 you will test functions responsible for adding and deleting list items. In part 2 you will test the status and content updates as well as the order re-position of items in the list.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Used [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as bundler
- Icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as test runner
- (Used Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint as linters)

## Live Demo

You can check a live working version of this project here: [live-demo](https://slowkingv.github.io/todo-list/)

## Getting started

This project makes use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle all the JS modules, and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons.

### Setup

Clone the repository into your local machine and then run `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Then after making any changes inside the `src/` folder, you can run `npm run build` to generate the corresponding files inside `dist/` directory.

### Run tests

If you want to test your changes on the fly without having to build every time, you can use `npm run start` to start the `webpack-dev-server` in development mode. This will watch for any changes you make and update the page accordingly.

To run the test files just run `npm test`.

To check the linters on your local env, make sure you have installed all dependencies (`npm install`) and then copy and paste the following files inside the root of the project: [.hintrc](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/html-css/.hintrc), [.stylelintrc.json](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/html-css/.stylelintrc.json), and [.eslintrc.json](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/html-css-js/.eslintrc.json).
